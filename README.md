# WHY IS THIS CRASHING?

I have wasted far too much time on this.  If anywone can point me to where I am going wrong here, please help.

I can delete any row except the last one.  When I delete the last one, I get an index out of range error.

I have a work around to get this to work, but I want to know WHY this is failing.
